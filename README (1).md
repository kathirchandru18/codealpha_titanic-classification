## Titanic Survival Prediction System

## Overview:
The Titanic Classification project is a data science endeavor aimed at predicting whether a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic using machine learning algorithms. By analyzing various factors such as age, gender, socio-economic status, and more, this project seeks to understand the determinants of survival during this historic disaster.

## Project Workflow:

**1. Data Collection and Overview:**
   - Gathered the Titanic dataset containing passenger information.
   - Conducted initial data exploration to understand the dataset's structure.

**2. Data Preprocessing and Cleaning:**
   - Handled missing values, outliers, and converted categorical variables.
   - Ensured the dataset was ready for analysis and modeling.

**3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualized and analyzed dataset characteristics.
   - Explored relationships between variables to identify patterns and trends.

**4. Feature Engineering:**
   - Created new features or modified existing ones to enhance model prediction.
   - Generated meaningful features such as age groups and extracted titles from names.

**5. Model Selection and Training:**
   - Selected machine learning models for classification (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forests).
   - Split the data into training and testing sets and trained various models.
   - Evaluated model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

**6. Model Evaluation and Performance Metrics:**
   - Conducted detailed evaluation of selected models on test data.
   - Compared models using various evaluation metrics.
   - Performed hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

**7. Conclusion and Results:**
   - Summarized classification model results.
   - Identified important features for prediction and discussed model strengths and weaknesses.
   - Provided overall assessment of project success and suggested future improvements.
